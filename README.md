## Overview

The sphinx is a legendary creature appearing in both Greek and Egyptian mythology with distinct characteristics in each tradition.

The **Greek sphinx** has a lion's body, woman's head, eagle's wings, and sometimes a serpent's tail. She guarded the city of Thebes, posing a riddle to travelers and killing those who failed to answer correctly until defeated by Oedipus.

The **Egyptian sphinx** features a lion's body with a human head (typically male, often representing a pharaoh) and serves as a guardian of tombs and temples, symbolizing royal power and wisdom. The most famous example is the Great Sphinx of Giza, a massive limestone monument approximately 66 feet high and 240 feet long, dating to c. 2500 BCE.

The sphinx represents mystery, wisdom, guardianship, and in Greek tradition, the danger of unanswered questions.
